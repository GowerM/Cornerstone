<h1>Statement of Faith</h1>

<p>In John 14:6 Jesus said, “I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me”.  Cornerstone Christian Academy is committed to educating and training children in “The Way”, “The Truth”, and “The Life”.</p>

<h5>The Way:</h5> <p>Deuteronomy 6:7 and Proverbs 22:6 show that that the primary responsibility of education lies with the parents. Cornerstone aids parents and helps facilitate the process of each child learning the ways of the Lord.</p>

<h5>The Truth:</h5> <p>In John 8:31-32 Jesus spoke to His followers about continuing in His Word, being disciples, knowing the truth, and the truth setting them free. Cornerstone believes in disciplining children in the truths of the Bible, so that as they grow into men and women of God, they will in turn disciple others to follow Jesus. We also believe that one of education’s main goals is to search out truth. As educators, we will try to bring truth to subject areas and will encourage students to use Biblical truths to interpret what they see and hear.</p>

<h5>The Life:</h5> <p>Matthew 6:33 tells us that we are to seek first the Kingdom of God and all of life’s needs shall be added unto us. At Cornerstone we know that if we teach our students to seek the Kingdom of God first and foremost in their lives, that Jesus will be faithful to fulfill His promise to each individual.</p>

<p>But as for you, continue in what you have learned and have become convinced of, because you know those from whom you learned it, ...
2 Timothy 3:14</p>
