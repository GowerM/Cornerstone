<p>Hello, my name is Julie Murphy and I am the Kindergarten teacher for Cornerstone. I have been a substitute teacher for the past eleven years for pre-school through high school. Most of my experience has been teaching in small rural schools or private Christian schools.  I completed my Bachelor of Education at EWU with a major in math and a minor in special education. I also earned my Masters of Education at EWU.</p>

      <p>I have been married for 27 years. We have four children, ages 20-26, and a 2 year old granddaughter. I am active at Sprague Community Church in children and women's ministries. I enjoy reading, cross stitching, and walking.</p>

       <p>I am excited for the kindergarteners as they begin to read and write. It is a blessing to be in a school where these students also learn about God’s truths and hide His Word in their hearts.  We also enjoy time for crafts, recreation, and music. I look forward to teaching the kindergarten class. </p>
